# Rounding with Function Calls


These exercises give you practice calling functions in Python.

```{python}
# Run this cell to set up the notebook, but please don't change it.
# These lines load the tests.
from client.api.notebook import Notebook
ok = Notebook('rounding.ok')
```

**Question 1.** Using the function `round`, round the number 1.23456789 to the nearest integer.  Give the result the name `rounded`.

```{python}
rounded = 1
rounded
```

```{python}
_ = ok.grade('q1')
```

**Question 2.** Round 1.23456789 to the nearest *thousandth* (.001).

*Hint:* Running `round?` in a code cell will show you Python's documentation for the `round` function.

```{python}
less_rounded = ...
less_rounded
```

```{python}
_ = ok.grade('q2')
```

Suppose you're counting all the small donations made to a political candidate.  The donations were:

* 32.25
* 15.00
* 24.45

You need to report the total rounded to the nearest dollar.

**Question 3.** First you decide to round *each donation* individually and then add up those 3 rounded amounts.  Compute that.

```{python}
# You probably want something starting: round(32.25) + ...
sum_of_rounded_amounts = ...
sum_of_rounded_amounts
```

```{python}
_ = ok.grade('q3')
```

**Question 4.** You suspect this method doesn't work quite right.  To check, you decide to try a different method: Adding up the donations, and then rounding the total.  Compute that.

```{python}
rounded_sum = ...
rounded_sum
```

```{python}
_ = ok.grade('q4')
```

```{python}
# For your convenience, you can run this cell to run all the tests at once!
import os
_ = [ok.grade(q[:-3]) for q in os.listdir("tests") if q.startswith('q')]
```
